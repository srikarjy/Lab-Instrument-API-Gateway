# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Lab Instrument API Gateway is a high-performance gRPC-based service designed to manage laboratory instrument connections, real-time data streaming, and device control. The system will serve as a centralized gateway for multiple laboratory instruments, providing device registration, bidirectional data streaming, command execution, and historical data retrieval capabilities. The gateway must support 1000+ concurrent device connections, handle 10,000+ messages per second, and maintain 99.9% uptime while deployed on AWS EKS.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Device Registration and Management

**User Story:** As a laboratory technician, I want to register and manage laboratory instruments through the gateway, so that I can centrally control and monitor all connected devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a laboratory instrument connects to the gateway THEN the system SHALL register the device with unique identification
2. WHEN a device registration request is received THEN the system SHALL validate device credentials and configuration
3. WHEN a device is successfully registered THEN the system SHALL persist device metadata and status information
4. WHEN a registered device disconnects THEN the system SHALL update the device status and maintain connection history
5. IF a device attempts to register with invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL reject the registration and log the attempt

### Requirement 2: Real-time Bidirectional Data Streaming

**User Story:** As a laboratory instrument, I want to stream measurement data in real-time to the gateway and receive commands, so that I can provide continuous monitoring and respond to control instructions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a registered device initiates a data stream THEN the system SHALL establish a bidirectional gRPC stream
2. WHEN measurement data is received through the stream THEN the system SHALL validate, process, and persist the data within 100ms
3. WHEN the system needs to send a command to a device THEN the system SHALL deliver it through the established stream
4. WHEN a stream experiences network issues THEN the system SHALL implement automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
5. WHEN concurrent streams exceed 1000 connections THEN the system SHALL maintain performance and stability
6. IF data validation fails THEN the system SHALL reject the data and notify the sending device

### Requirement 3: Command Execution and Control

**User Story:** As a laboratory operator, I want to send commands to instruments through the gateway, so that I can remotely control device operations and configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a command is sent to a device THEN the system SHALL validate the command format and target device
2. WHEN a valid command is processed THEN the system SHALL route it to the appropriate device within 50ms
3. WHEN a command is executed THEN the system SHALL track command status and response
4. WHEN a command times out THEN the system SHALL mark it as failed and notify the requesting client
5. IF a command is sent to an offline device THEN the system SHALL queue the command or reject it based on configuration

### Requirement 4: Historical Data Retrieval and Analytics

**User Story:** As a research scientist, I want to query historical measurement data from instruments, so that I can analyze trends and generate reports.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a historical data query is received THEN the system SHALL support time-range filtering and device selection
2. WHEN querying large datasets THEN the system SHALL implement pagination with configurable page sizes
3. WHEN data aggregation is requested THEN the system SHALL provide statistical summaries and time-based grouping
4. WHEN concurrent queries exceed system capacity THEN the system SHALL implement query throttling and prioritization
5. IF a query requests data beyond retention period THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages

### Requirement 5: Device Status Monitoring and Health Checks

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor the health and status of all connected instruments, so that I can ensure system reliability and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a device status is requested THEN the system SHALL provide real-time connection status, last activity, and health metrics
2. WHEN a device becomes unresponsive THEN the system SHALL detect the condition within 30 seconds and update status
3. WHEN system health is queried THEN the system SHALL provide overall gateway status, performance metrics, and resource utilization
4. WHEN critical issues are detected THEN the system SHALL generate alerts and notifications
5. IF a device fails health checks repeatedly THEN the system SHALL mark it as unhealthy and attempt recovery procedures

### Requirement 6: High Availability and Scalability

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the gateway to be highly available and scalable, so that it can handle growing laboratory demands without service interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployed on AWS EKS THEN the system SHALL support horizontal pod autoscaling based on CPU and memory metrics
2. WHEN database failover occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain service availability with minimal disruption
3. WHEN system load increases THEN the system SHALL automatically scale to handle up to 10,000 messages per second
4. WHEN maintenance is required THEN the system SHALL support rolling updates without service downtime
5. IF a pod fails THEN the system SHALL automatically restart and redistribute load within 60 seconds

### Requirement 7: Security and Authentication

**User Story:** As a security officer, I want the gateway to implement comprehensive security measures, so that laboratory data and device access are protected from unauthorized use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN devices connect to the gateway THEN the system SHALL require mutual TLS authentication
2. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL validate authentication tokens and authorization levels
3. WHEN sensitive data is transmitted THEN the system SHALL encrypt all communications using industry-standard protocols
4. WHEN security events occur THEN the system SHALL log all authentication attempts and access patterns
5. IF unauthorized access is detected THEN the system SHALL block the connection and alert administrators

### Requirement 8: Monitoring and Observability

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want comprehensive monitoring and logging capabilities, so that I can maintain system performance and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is running THEN it SHALL expose Prometheus metrics for performance monitoring
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL generate structured logs with appropriate severity levels
3. WHEN performance thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL trigger alerts through configured channels
4. WHEN troubleshooting is needed THEN the system SHALL provide distributed tracing for request flows
5. IF system resources are constrained THEN monitoring SHALL continue to function with minimal performance impact
